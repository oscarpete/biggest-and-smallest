# Finding the biggest and smallest Number!

Welcome to the project that has one particular challenge, find which of the following 2 numbers given by the end user will be the biggest and which one will be the smallest!

--------------------------------

## What to expect?

Well the main problem is convert the user input into a number that the script will save first, and then will compare with the next number. As you can imagine this means that the number has to be storage on the site, not forever of course! Only the time the end user set their minds to think in 2 fu#!ng numbers!
And after all this you need to a reset buttom, because you know, we need to try another number!

##Technologies to use:
Java Script
HTML
